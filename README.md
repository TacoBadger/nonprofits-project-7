# Analysis of the Netflix Top 10 Dataset in Kaggle.

Worked with the dataset to find the Top titles on Netflix in US from 2020-04-01 to 2022-03-11. The dataset is a public dataset made available through Prasert Kanawattanachai on Kaggle. Please do take note that this document is for practice purposes only and it does not include any marketing of the titles involved.

## What I want to find out?
- Number of titles
- Top ten titles
- Top ten least titles
- How many of them were Netflix Exclusive and Not
- Most watched type
- Top ten TV Shows
- Top ten Movies
- Top six Stand-Up Comedy

The time frame of the data is from 2020-04-01 to 2022-03-11. The dataset is a public dataset made available through Prasert Kanawattanachai on Kaggle.

## Dataset
- [Kaggle Netflix Top 10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/netflix-daily-top-10-in-us)

It includes:
-  As Of: the snapshot date for each datapoint.
- Rank: A 1-10 scale representing the streaming time of each show for a given date.
- Year to Date Rank: A 1-10 scale representing the overall rank relative to all other shows that year (these rankings shift around quite a lot as this is recalculated by the day).
- Last Week Rank: A 1-10 scale showing the overall rank for the prior week.
- Title: The name of the show or special in question.
- Netflix Exclusive: Whether the show is a Netflix exclusive.
- Netflix Release Date: The date which the show debuted on Netflix
- Days in Top 10: How many total days a show has appeared in the Top 10 by the As Of date.
- Viewership Score: This statistic was reworked in late 2021 and was not used in the analysis.

## ASK
We took a look at the raw data set mentioned and come up with the questions I want to answer. This can be your own questions based on your interest about the data.

Questions:
- How many titles are there in the dataset?
- What is the top 10 titles in the whole dataset?
- What is the top 10 least titles in the whole dataset?
- How many of them are Netflix Exclusive and not?
- What is the most watched type?
- What is the top 10 TV Shows?
- What is the top 10 Movies?
- What is the top 6 Stand-Up Comedy?

## PREPARE
We downloaded the data in a zip file and uploaded it in directly to RStudio Cloud or you can use this code to import the dataset. Make sure to install and load the readr package in RStudio. You can always take a look in our [Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/TacoBadger/NetflixDataset/blob/main/Assets/netflix-dataset.ipynb) whenever you need help with a line.

```
netflix_data <- read_csv("netflix daily top 10.csv")
View(netflix_data)
```

## PROCESS
In this step we took our time to process and clean our data. Here a sample of our cleaning process which involves changing the column names to lower case and changing all the NA values to Others.

```
netflix_data <- netflix_data %>% rename_with(tolower) %>% 
  rename(date = "as of", 
         year_to_date_rank = "year to date rank",
         last_week_rank = "last week rank",
         production = "netflix exclusive",
         netflix_release_date = "netflix release date",
         days_in_top_10 = "days in top 10",
         viewership_score = "viewership score")


View(netflix_data)

#replace NA values in production column to "others"
netflix_data <- netflix_data %<>% mutate(production = fct_explicit_na(production, na_level = "Others")) 
View(netflix_data)
```

We also took time to clean out all the spelling mistakes and duplicates. You can take a look at the whole process on correcting all the spelling mistakes in [Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/TacoBadger/NetflixDataset/blob/main/Assets/netflix-dataset.ipynb) 

```
netflix_data <- mutate(netflix_data, title = recode(.x=title, "Tiger King"="Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness"))
netflix_data <- mutate(netflix_data, title = recode(.x=title, "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem …"="Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness"))
netflix_data <- mutate(netflix_data, title = recode(.x=title, "Jerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to…"="Jerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to Kill"))
netflix_data <- mutate(netflix_data, title = recode(.x=title, "George Lopez: Weâll Do It f…"="George Lopez: We'll Do It for Half"))
netflix_data <- mutate(netflix_data, title = recode(.x=title, "The Queenâs Gambit"="The Queen's Gambit"))
```

## ANALYZE
We took a look at out cleaned data and filtered them to the data we need to answer our questions. We also made new tables that is already sorted and filtered to answer our questions. The whole process can be found in [Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/TacoBadger/NetflixDataset/blob/main/Assets/netflix-dataset.ipynb) 

```

## What is next?
Thank you for reading my doccumentation about my Netflix Dataset. To help me improve more of my basic data analytical skills I will list down a few pointers on what's next for my other projects.

- I could have improved my data story telling or I could have made a more compelling narrative by including all detailed and relevant explanation in my documentation, I should know what my target audience is and start telling my data from there. I should also be including basic terms especially for beginners reading my documentation.
- I could have improved my keypointers that can lead the audience to understand more about my data analysis. I could have make use of highlighting all important keywords and relevant data for our target audience.
- A more detailed explanation of the codes used and functions. We can use a small summary for our target audience.
- A more effective way of using visuals where our target audience can easily understand it. Always make sure you choose the proper visual to express your dataset. 
-  We will also start using SQL for our next dataset practice which involves more functions and commands that is more complex than in RStudio. We will specifically used DB Browser SQLite for our next ptractice, DB Browser works similar to SQL in some functions and commands so let us learn about it together in the next dataset. 

See you on our next project!
